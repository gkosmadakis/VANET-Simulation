# VANET-Simulation

This is a project completed for my dissertation in my master's degree at the University.

The project aimed to provide a comparative study between seven studies discovered in the literature who propose ways to identify 

selfish nodes in vehicular ad hoc network. Three protocols have been implemented out of the seven studies. The implementation was 

undertaken in a mobility simulator with Java, which was built from scratch to the requirements of this project.
